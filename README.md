## Chat Widget Implementation

### Functionality

- **User Interaction**: Users can send messages through a chat input field. The chatbot responds after processing the userâ€™s message via the OpenRouter AI API.
- **API Handling**: The bot uses the `POST` endpoint to send the userâ€™s message and fetch the response from the AI model (Meta LLaMA).
- **State Management**: The component uses React state to manage messages, loading states, and widget visibility.
- **Responsive Layout**: The chat widget is fixed to the bottom-right corner of the screen and is fully responsive.

### Chat Widget Features
- **Floating Button**: A chat icon (ðŸ’¬) appears when the widget is minimized, located at the bottom-right of the screen.
- **Smooth Transitions**: The widget opens and closes with a smooth transition effect.
- **Loading State**: While waiting for the bot's response, a "Typing..." indicator is shown.
- **User & Bot Messages**: Messages from both the user and the bot are styled distinctly for easy readability.
- **Close Button**: The chat window can be closed by clicking the "âœ–" button at the top-right corner.
